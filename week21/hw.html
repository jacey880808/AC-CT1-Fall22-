    <h1>Archeology of The Futures</h1> <br>
    <h2>01 Background</h2> 
    <h6>The world is moving faster than ever. <br>
        The essence of new technologies and new changes is to eliminate low efficiency with high efficiency. <br>
        Most people think that the innovation of the times is to increase productivity, <br>
        but in fact, the rise of the new era will once again eliminate the groups that have not mastered new technologies.<br>
         Through the promotion of capitalism, it is true that our society is more progressive.<br>
          However, with fierce competitiveness, the decadent production relations directly lead to the increasing life pressure of young people.</h6> <br>

    <h4>Punched-Card Machine for Pressure</h4>
    <h6>I want to do a punched-card machine for pressure.<br>
         On the one hand, it simulates the condition that young people punch in and out for work daily.<br>
        They cannot change their situations while suffering extreme pressure, <br>
        leading to terrible physical and mental disorders.</h6> 
    <h6>How does it work?<br> Put the finger in the middle of the punched-card machine,<br>
         which will start to sensor the user’s pulse to speculate the pressure level.<br>
         And then, the color paper will be printed, which the user could paste on the calendar to see the changes through a month. <br>
        ( “Red” paper means the user suffered from severe stress and should be aware of their mental conditions. <br>
         As for “Blue,” it means the light pressure.)</h6>
