    <h4>Goal</h4>
    <h6>To question the relativity of perception and how it informs the apprehension of our surrounding.  To see itself as “ a means of return” rather than “escape”, facilitating a temporary release from our habitual perceptions and culturally baised assumptons.</h6>
    <h4>Diagram of process</h4>
    <img src="diagram.jpg" width="1200px">
    <h6>An immersant’s awareness of physical self is transformed by being surrounded in an engrossing environment; often artificial, creating a perception of presence in a non-physical world.
    </h6>
    <h4>Challenge</h4>
    <h6>Try to use “Processing” to imitate the effect of “particle lights”, which blur and interconnect (Put focus on visualization)=Particle Systems in P5js / Multiple Particle Systems. </h6>
