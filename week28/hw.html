    <h4>Game Concept</h4>
    <h6>Circle Rush </br>
        In Circle Rush, the player controls a character moving around a square arena. The objective of the game is to collect as many points as possible before the time limit runs out. The player earns points by collecting the circles scattered throughout the arena, but they must also avoid obstacles that deduct points upon collision.

    <h6>The objective of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible before the time limit expires. Players can earn points by collecting the rewarding circles scattered throughout the game, but points will be deducted for colliding with obstacles. At the end of the designated time frame, the player with the highest score will emerge as the winner.
