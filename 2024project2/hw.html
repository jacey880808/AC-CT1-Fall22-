    <h1> ChatBox with Simple AI </h1> 
    <h2>Exploration</h2>
    <h4>What kind of personality does your bot have?</h4>
    <p>The robot is a sweet helper for users to greet them and inquire about their moods! It serves as a friendly companion, offering emotional support and interaction. </p>
    <h4>What might you want your bot to do? </h4>
    <p>My robot is designed to record usersâ€™ daily moods! It allows users to engage in a meaningful way and provide appropriate responses based on their expressed moods. This could be beneficial in settings where people might appreciate companionship and emotional support.</p>


    <h2>Process</h2>
    <h4>Key decisions you are making and your thinking behind them. </h4>
    <p>Users can choose the color which best represents how they feel. For example, users may select blue for sadness, red for happiness, or green for calmness, The color selection feature is easy to use and offer a wide options. Also, the robot will give the table for the user to write down their thoughts for record.
    </p>
    <h4> Any changes in the intent or the substance of the bot.</h4>
    <p>The intent of the feature is to promote emotional awareness, self-reflection, while also providing  a means for them to track their mood from collecting their thoughts.
    </p>
    <h4>Errors and mishaps - how did you resolve them, or how did you avoid them
        Key successes along the way.</h4>
    <p>It was difficult for me to differentiate the order of multiple options. I consider the best way to resolve this was write them down to make sure the logic behind the codes.
