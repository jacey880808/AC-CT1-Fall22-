    <h1>PROJECT 3 Virtual Dream Space - DOCUMENTATION</h1><br>
    <h2>01 Ideation and Possibilities</h2> 

    <h4>What kind environment it will be?</h4>
    <h6>This dream space would serve as a personalized and meaningful visual representation of my core values, aspirations, and fears, inspiring me to continue pursuing my life goals with purpose and motivation. <br>
        To create a dynamic and visually stimulating environment, I plan to incorporate various geometric shapes such as triangles, circles, or squares in different sizes and colors. Each shape would symbolize a specific aspect of my life, such as growth or balance, while abstract objects would be created to represent significant life experiences and cherished memories. Additionally, I intend to include objects that represent my fears or challenges as a reminder of the obstacles I have overcome or still need to face, contributing to my personal growth and development.
    </h6>

    <h4>Which objects it will contain?</h4>
    <h6><u><b>Growth and Progress</b></u><br>
        Ladders — represent the idea of climbing upward and reaching new heights, both in a physical and metaphorical sense. They symbolize my desire to overcome challenges and obstacles to achieve goals, as well as the importance of perseverance and hard work.<br>
        Plants — symbolize the importance of nature in my lives, and the idea that growth and progress are a natural part of life. It can also represent the need for self-care, and the idea that taking care of ourselves is essential to personal growth and development. <br>

    <h6><u><b>Fears and Unknown</b></u><br>
        A black hole — is a representation of the vast and unknown universe, and can symbolize the infinite possibilities and potential that await us. It can be a powerful reminder of the endless potential and opportunities that are available to me.<br>
        A narrow hallway with doors — represents a more personal and internal fear of the unknown. The narrow hallway represents the feeling of being confined or trapped; as for the doors leading to a brighter and more open space represent the possibility of overcoming our fears and discovering new opportunities and experiences.
    </h6>

    <h6>It would be a journey through the space. At first, it starts with the narrow hallway with doors, on behalf of the fear of the unknown, leading to the more open and dynamic main space. As for the main space, it would be divided into different section, with each section dedicated to representing different aspects of life and interests.
