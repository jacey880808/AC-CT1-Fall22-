<h2> Problems and Solutions</h2>
    <p>1. Particles wouldn’t move > use TAU (an alias for TWO_PI) <br>
    2. All lines just go on the same routine > noiseScale controls the flow of lines <br>
    3. The lines go linear without the definition of sin(a) /cos(a)</p>
    
   <h2> Sharing (what the problem is / how to solve it)</h2>
    The particles stood still and would not move as I tried at first. I tried to add the function of the noiseScale but I found that there was nothing changes. <br>
    
    Finally, I found the function of “ TAU” sin( ) and cos ( ). It could control the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Hence, the lines could go randomly and non-linear.
